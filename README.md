**An expert guide to improving database scalability and availability without compromising performance**

## What is this book about?
With ever-increasing rates of data creation, the demand for storing data fast and reliably becomes a need. Apache Cassandra is the perfect choice for building fault-tolerant and scalable databases. Mastering Apache Cassandra 3.x teaches you how to build and architect your clusters, configure and work with your nodes, and program in a high-throughput environment, helping you understand the power of Cassandra as per the new features.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Write programs more efficiently using Cassandra's features more efficiently

* Exploit the given infrastructure, improve performance, and tweak the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

* Use CQL3 in your application in order to simplify working with Cassandra

* Configure Cassandra and fine-tune its parameters depending on your needs

* Set up a cluster and learn how to scale it
